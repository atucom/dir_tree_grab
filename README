This Ruby script is fairly simple, it just logs into the specified server
generates a listing of the absolute paths for every file on the system
and then pulls it down to your box.

The point of this was so i could quickly iterate through a crap ton of 
machines so i could find servers with juicy looking filenames.

It requires winexe-PTH installed on the system and in the PATH
